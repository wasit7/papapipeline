# Project Report Template

This template outlines the structure for your project report, which is worth the final 10 marks of your project (5 marks for visualization and 5 marks for machine learning). It also includes a section to provide evidence for the previous 90 marks to give context.

## Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of your project.
- State the goals and objectives you aimed to achieve.

## Evidences for the Previous 90 Marks
- **Purpose**: This section is not graded but provides context for the graded components by showing how you met the project's technical requirements.
- **Details**:
  - Summarize how you fulfilled the criteria for the first 90 marks (e.g., repository setup, consistent commits, dataset preparation).
  - Include screenshots, links to your repository, or examples of your dataset.
  - Mention any challenges encountered and how you addressed them.

## Visualization of the Gathered Data (5 Marks)
- **Purpose**: Showcase your ability to present data visually and derive meaningful insights.
- **Content**:
  - **Visualization 1**: [Insert title, e.g., "Temperature Trends Over Time"]
    - Description: Include a line graph (or other suitable chart) showing your data.
    - Labels: Ensure clear titles, axis labels, and legends.
    - Insight: E.g., "The data shows a clear increase in temperature during midday hours."
  - **Visualization 2**: [Insert title, e.g., "Distribution of Rainfall"]
    - Description: Use a histogram (or other type) to represent your data.
    - Labels: Include titles, axis labels, and legends as needed.
    - Insight: E.g., "Most rainfall occurs in short, intense bursts."
- **Tools**: Consider using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
- **Tip**: Use at least two different visualization types to demonstrate variety.

## Machine Learning Application (5 Marks)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate your ability to apply machine learning techniques to your data.
- **Content**:
  - **Problem Statement**: Define what you’re analyzing or predicting (e.g., "Predicting temperature based on time of day").
  - **Model and Approach**: 
    - Select a simple model (e.g., linear regression or decision tree).
    - Briefly describe data preparation (e.g., splitting into training/testing sets).
  - **Results and Evaluation**: 
    - Report performance metrics (e.g., "The model achieved an accuracy of 85%").
    - Include any relevant figures or tables if applicable.
  - **Key Learnings**: 
    - Summarize what the model revealed (e.g., "Time of day strongly correlates with temperature").
    - Reflect on whether it aligned with your expectations.
- **Tip**: Prioritize clarity and correctness over complexity.

## Conclusion
- Recap your project’s achievements.
- Suggest potential improvements or next steps for future work.
