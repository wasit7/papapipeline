# Scoring System Explanation for Undergraduate Students (Total: 100 Points)

The scoring system for your project is straightforward and designed to assess various aspects of your work. It’s based on a total of 100 points, broken down into clear categories. Here’s how it works:

## 1. Repository Setup (10 Points)
- **What it’s about**: Did you create your project repository on time and name it correctly?
- **Why it matters**: Shows you’re organized and can follow instructions.
- **Scoring**:
  - 10 points: Repository created within the first week and named as specified.
  - 0 points: If not done on time or incorrectly named.

## 2. Commit Frequency (10 Points)
- **What it’s about**: How often you save (commit) your work to the repository each week.
- **Why it matters**: Regular commits mean you’re making steady progress and using version control well.
- **Scoring**:
  - You’re evaluated over three weeks.
  - 10 points per week: At least 5 commits.
  - Fewer commits = partial points (e.g., 3 commits = 6 points).
  - Final score: Average of the three weeks.

## 3. README Quality (10 Points)
- **What it’s about**: How good your project’s README file is.
- **Why it matters**: A clear README helps others understand your project.
- **Scoring**:
  - 10 points: README has at least 1,000 characters.
  - Less than 1,000: Proportional points (e.g., 500 characters = 5 points).

## 4. Dataset Quality (50 Points)
This is the biggest chunk, split into five parts, each worth 10 points:

- **Record Count**:
  - 10 points: Dataset has 1,000+ records.
  - 0 points: Fewer than 1,000 records.
- **Time Span**:
  - 10 points: Data covers at least 24 hours.
  - 0 points: Less than 24 hours.
- **Completeness**:
  - 10 points: Dataset is 90%+ complete (few missing records).
  - 0 points: Less than 90% complete.
- **Data Types**:
  - 10 points: No columns use the generic ‘object’ type.
  - 0 points: Any ‘object’ type columns.
- **No Duplicates**:
  - 10 points: No duplicate rows.
  - 0 points: Duplicates found.

## 5. Schema Compliance (10 Points)
- **What it’s about**: Does your dataset’s structure match the expected format?
- **Why it matters**: Ensures your data is consistent and usable.
- **Scoring**:
  - 10 points: Schema matches perfectly.
  - 0 points: Schema doesn’t match.

## Total Score Breakdown
- **Maximum**: 100 points
- **Categories**:
  - Repository Setup: 10 points
  - Commit Frequency: 10 points
  - README Quality: 10 points
  - Dataset Quality: 50 points (5 sub-criteria x 10 points each)
  - Schema Compliance: 10 points
  - Report (manual scoring): 10 points

## Why This System?
It’s built to be fair and thorough, rewarding effort, technical skills, and clear communication. By splitting the score into parts, you can see exactly where to improve. Aim high in each area—it’ll boost your grade and your learning!
