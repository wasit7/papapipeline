# Prefect 3 Tutorial: Deploying and Running Flows

## Overview
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up **Prefect 3** and deploying a simple flow using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Prefect Work Pool**. It demonstrates how to:
- Set up Prefect using **Docker Compose**
- Generate SSH keys for GitHub authentication
- Clone a GitHub repository
- Create and deploy a Prefect flow

## Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** installed on your machine.
- **GitHub account** for storing and retrieving flow definitions.
- **Python 3.11** (installed in the container).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1️⃣ **Build and Run the Prefect Environment**
Run the following commands to build and start the Prefect services:
```sh
cd tutorial03
docker compose up --build
```
This will start:
- **Prefect Server**
- **Prefect Worker**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PostgreSQL Database** (for Prefect's backend)

---

### 2️⃣ **Set Up SSH Keys for GitHub**
To push and pull flow definitions from GitHub, generate an SSH key:
```sh
docker compose exec jupyter bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Copy the output and **add it to GitHub**:  
👉 Go to **GitHub Settings → SSH Keys → Add a new key**  
👉 Paste the copied key and save.

Test the connection:
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
You should see:
```
Hi yourusername! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
Now, clone the tutorial repository inside the Jupyter container:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:wasit7/prefect_demo.git
cd prefect_demo
```
---

### 4️⃣ **Create and Test the Flow**

📌 **Create a simple flow in `hello_flow.py`**
```python
from prefect import flow

@flow
def hello_flow():
    print("Hello, DIS321: Big Data Infrastructure!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_flow()
```
Run the flow:
```sh
python hello_flow.py
```
Expected output:
```
Hello, DIS321: Big Data Infrastructure!
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Deploy the Flow**
Create `deploy.py` to deploy the flow via Prefect Work Pool:
```python
from prefect import flow

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source="https://github.com/wasit7/prefect_demo.git",
        entrypoint="hello_flow.py:hello_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="my-first-deployment",
        parameters={"key": "value"},
        work_pool_name="default-agent-pool",
        cron="* * * * *",  # Runs every minute
    )
```

Run:
```sh
python deploy.py
```
This will register **hello_flow** as a Prefect deployment.

---

### 6️⃣ **Check Prefect UI**
Visit the Prefect UI at:
```
http://localhost:4200
```
- Navigate to **Deployments** and check if **hello_flow** is listed.
- Check **Work Pool** to see the execution status.

---

### 7️⃣ **Run the Deployment**
Manually trigger the flow execution:
```sh
prefect deployment run my-first-deployment
```

To view logs:
```sh
prefect logs
```

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
You have successfully:
✅ Set up Prefect with **Docker Compose**  
✅ Created an **SSH key** for GitHub authentication  
✅ **Cloned a repository** and created a flow  
✅ **Deployed** a Prefect flow using Work Pools  
✅ Monitored executions in the **Prefect UI**  

You are now ready to build more complex **ETL workflows** and **data pipelines** using Prefect 3! 🚀🎯
