# **Chapter 11: Integration, Review & Final Presentation**

*A friendly guide to ‚Äúputting it all together‚Äù*

You have written code that cleans data, draws charts, trains a model, and ships everything through a one-click deployment.  Great!  The last step in any real project‚Äîinside or outside university‚Äîis to **prove** that your work runs smoothly *and* tell a clear story about it.  This chapter walks you through the final two weeks:

1. **Integrate** every chapter‚Äôs piece into one repo and one Prefect workspace.
2. **Review** your own work and each other‚Äôs pull-requests.
3. **Present** a confident, five-minute live demo plus slides.

All tips are written for undergraduate students: no corporate buzzwords, just practical steps.

## 11.0 What ‚Äúdone‚Äù looks like

| Deliverable                                                                                                   | Where the grader will check |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Git repo `dsi321` with ‚â• 15 meaningful commits                                                                | GitHub commit list          |
| `README.md` ‚â• 1 000 characters + build badge                                                                  | Repo home page              |
| One-command deployment (`docker compose up --build`)                                                          | Instructor runs locally     |
| Green CI check on last commit                                                                                 | GitHub Actions              |
| Prefect UI shows **three** scheduled deployments:<br> ‚Ä¢ `ingest-clean`<br> ‚Ä¢ `eda-pm25`<br> ‚Ä¢ `pm25-baseline` | Live during demo            |
| Flow-run artifacts: quality table, coverage plot, prediction plot                                             | Prefect ‚ÄúArtifacts‚Äù tab     |
| Slide deck (‚â§ 8 slides) in `slides/` folder                                                                   | Repo & presentation         |
| 5-minute live demo + 2-minute Q\&A                                                                            | Final session               |

## 11.1 Freeze the code (but not the data)

1. **Branch naming**

   * `dev` ‚Äì keep hacking here
   * `release-candidate` ‚Äì final polish
   * `main` ‚Äì code that always works

2. When you open a pull-request from `release-candidate` into `main`, **check that CI passes**.

3. Tag the merge commit:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

## 11.2 Peer-review checklist (‚ÄúLGTM‚Äù with meaning)

Before approving a teammate‚Äôs PR, answer **yes** to every line:

| ‚úì  | Question                                                   |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚òê  | Does `ruff` or `flake8` show **zero** errors?              |
| ‚òê  | Do unit tests (`pytest`) pass?                             |
| ‚òê  | Can I run `docker compose up --build` and see Prefect UI?  |
| ‚òê  | Does the README explain how to trigger each flow?          |
| ‚òê  | Is there at least one screenshot or diagram in the README? |
| ‚òê  | Are secrets **not** included in the repo?                  |

If any box is unchecked, request changes‚Äîthis is how software teams avoid last-minute fire drills.

## 11.3 Quality assurance ‚Äúself-audit‚Äù script (optional but handy)

```python
# scripts/self_audit.py
from pathlib import Path

def check_figs():
    imgs = list(Path("figs").glob("*.png"))
    assert imgs, "No figures found in figs/"

def check_readme():
    txt = Path("README.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    assert len(txt) > 1000, "README < 1000 chars"

def run():
    check_figs()
    check_readme()
    print("‚úÖ Self-audit passed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Run this locally before the PR; it saves you ‚ÄúOops, forgot the plots!‚Äù moments.

## 11.4 Crafting the story: a slide-by-slide template

| Slide # | Content                               | Tip                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Title + team + one-sentence objective | ‚ÄúPredict hourly PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ in Bangkok with open data‚Äù      |
| 2       | Why PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ matters                     | One chart: WHO guideline vs Bangkok levels            |
| 3       | Pipeline diagram                      | Ingest ‚Üí Clean ‚Üí lakeFS ‚Üí EDA ‚Üí Model                 |
| 4       | Data quality snapshot                 | Table artifact: completeness & duplicates (all green) |
| 5       | Key EDA insight                       | Wind speed negative correlation plot                  |
| 6       | Model results                         | MAE, R¬≤, regression coefficients                      |
| 7       | Live demo checklist                   | bullets: start flow, show UI, show artifacts          |
| 8       | Next steps                            | e.g. random forest, deploy to cloud                   |

Keep text minimal; let charts speak.

## 11.5 Rehearsal: timing & backup

* Practice **click-path**:

  1. Open Prefect UI (bookmark).
  2. Trigger `ingest-clean` run -> show green.
  3. Click Artifacts tab, open plots.
  4. Open GitHub Actions page -> green check.

* Time yourself‚Äîtalk ‚â§ 5 min.

* **Backup plan**: record a 1-minute GIF of the UI in case Wi-Fi fails.

## 11.6 Presentation day ‚Äì 5 golden rules

1. **Start with the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù** The grader cares about impact, not just tech.
2. **Zoom, don‚Äôt scroll.** Show the exact UI element; audience won‚Äôt squint.
3. **Speak to humans.** Say ‚ÄúThe model‚Äôs MAE is 8 ¬µg/m¬≥‚Äîgood because WHO daily limit is 15.‚Äù
4. **Watch the clock.** A slide timer or phone on the lectern helps.
5. **Finish with thanks.** Invite questions confidently.

## 11.7 Rubric cross-walk table

Copy this into your README; the grader loves it.

| Rubric line         | Evidence in repo                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚â• 90 % completeness | `artifacts/summary.csv` & screenshots            |
| ‚â• 5 commits/week    | GitHub insights graph                            |
| One-command run     | Video link + `docker-compose.prod.yml`           |
| ML used             | `flows/pm25_baseline.py`, `figs/pred_vs_obs.png` |

## 11.8 After the demo: retrospective

Set aside 10 minutes with your team:

1. **What went well?** (e.g., early data-quality checks saved time)
2. **What was hard?** (Docker cache issues?)
3. **One improvement for next time.**

Write three bullet points in `RETROSPECTIVE.md`‚Äîfuture you will thank you.

---

## 11.9 Key take-aways

* **Integration first, polish second.** A working, if ugly, pipeline beats a perfect but broken one.
* **Automate the boring stuff.** CI prevents ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù excuses.
* **Tell a story.** Stakeholders remember clear visuals and numbers they can relate to.

You now have the full journey‚Äîfrom raw API call to nightly-retrained model‚Äîliving in a public repo, with automated quality gates and a presentation you can proudly add to your portfolio.

**Congratulations!** üéâ You‚Äôve completed the course.  Keep the repo alive; future employers and research supervisors will love to see real, working data-engineering artefacts.
